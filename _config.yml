          Automation of oxygen flow rate to give the best possible treatment to patients effected with COVID-19.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          A sponsered project in-association with Yashoda Hospitals and Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship - BITS Pilani under the guidance of [Prof. Balasubramanian. M](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/balasm/profile), [Dr.Alivelu Manga Parimi](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/alivelu/profile) and [Dr.Pratyush Chakraborty](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/pchakraborty/Profile). 
          - The oxygen flow rate is automated based on an expert-advice system
          - The device reduces oxygen wastage that is caused due to the need for manual adjustment of the flow rate based on the patient's vitals.
          - The device provides a closed loop feedback based approach for a responsive treatment based on the changing vitals of the patient.

          The rover was developed as a prototype for the Singapore Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge and was one of the first underwater robotics projects from BITS Pilani. 
          - Everything from the hull to the thrusters and propellers used in the rover were designed and fabricated inhouse. 
          - The overall cost of the rover was less by over 60% when compared to a rover made using COTS components. 
          - The rover features a unqiue shape and uses 4 thrusters (2 Vertial + 2 Horizontal) for navigating under water.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Initially started as a small DIY build to making racing experience in PC games more fun it quickly evolved into a full fledged project. 
          - The build consists of an steering wheel with capactive touch based buttons for brakes and other inputs.
          - The project is built using extremely inexpensice parts like the arduino uno and an ADXL 335. 
          - The software stack consists of an Arduino Uno that communicates with the Processing IDE via serial communication for implementing keyboard hooks through the robot class.

          Started as a fun DIY build in the search for interactive applications based on the Arduino Uno and TFT display boards.
          - A replica of the Dino game from Google Chrome for the Arduino Uno.
          - The hardware setup consited of a TFT Display, buzzer, tactile buttons and an Arduino Uno.
          - The game algorithm employs selective brush erasing instead of drawing the whole frame everytime and therefore renders the animations very smoothly.

          A program that can generate and visualize the 3D workspace of a N-DoF manipulator, the core of the project is based on the methods and applications discussed in the computational physics course by [Dr. P K Thiruvikraman](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/pkthirivikraman/profile).
          - The algorithm uses a custom forward kinematics and monte-carlo based solver for generating the points.
          - The algorithm can generate complex workspace shapes by just relying on the DH-parameters and joint angles as inputs. 
          - Potential applications involve collision and interference checking when used together with a planning algorithm.

          Inspired by sphero and the Goodyear spherical tire concept, this project aims to test out the feasabilty of an omnidirectional spherical robot.
          - An omnidirectional robot that consists of a modular two part outer shell with internal wheels.
          - The electronics stack consists of an Arduino Uno along with a motor driver and an RC reciever for wireless control.
          - Features a spring loaded two part mechanical assembly inspired from sphero for making sure the inner wheels and the outer shell have adequent contact forces.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
