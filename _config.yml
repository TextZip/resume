          An extremly affordable and opensource QDD Actuator inspired from the MIT mini-cheetah
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          An open-source project to build affordable QDD Actuators for use in proprioception and locomotion-based projects under the guidance of [Dr. Abhishek Sarkar](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/abhisheks/Profile).  
          - The actuator consists of a custom-built epicyclic gear train, a 400kv BLDC motor, on-axis magnetic encoder, and an Odrive. 
          - With a 6:1 gear ratio, the actuator has minimal backlash and excellent backdrivibilty, allowing it to produce torques up to 1.2Kgcm.
          - The mechanical assembly features modular parts that are easy to fabricate and build using standard workshop equipment, making the actuator cost 50% less than the commercially available variants.

          Automation of oxygen flow rate to give the best possible treatment to patients effected with COVID-19.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          A project in collaboration with Yashoda Hospitals and Centre for Innovation, Incubation, and Entrepreneurship - BITS Pilani. The project aims to automate the oxygen flow rate based on patient vitals for a more responsive patient care system, under the guidance of [Prof. Balasubramanian. M](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/balasm/profile), [Dr.Alivelu Manga Parimi](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/alivelu/profile) and [Dr.Pratyush Chakraborty](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/pchakraborty/Profile).
          - The hardware stack consists of a proportional solenoid valve, a microcontroller, and an SPO2 + heart rate sensor, along with a user interface that includes a display panel and buttons. 
          - The device is modular and portable, making it ideal for use in hospitals and outdoor settings with easy-to-fix attachments for connecting to existing oxygen supply infrastructure. 
          - The device reduces the need for constant medical supervision of patient vitals by automatically adjusting to the trends of the patient vitals in real-time by employing a closed-loop saturation-driven oxygen therapy coupled with an expert advice model.

          Navigation and localization of drones in GPS denied environments. 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          A project aimed at generating real-time orthomosaic maps using drones for localization and navigation under [Dr. K Rajitha](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/krajitha/Profile).
          - The system consists of a vertically downwards facing camera and an onboard IMU and FC for SLAM and navigation.
          - The system offers a cheap and affordable drone-based surveying platform that does not rely on external services like GPS and satellite data for localization. 
          - It has applications ranging from helping first responders understand the map after terrain altering natural/artificial events to surveying construction sites, farmlands, and forests.

          Started underwater robotics culture on campus.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The rover was developed as a prototype for the Singapore Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge and was one of the first underwater robotics projects from BITS Pilani. 
          - Everything from the hull to the thrusters and propellers used in the rover was designed and fabricated in-house.
          - The overall cost of the rover was less by over 60% compared to a rover made using COTS components.
          - The rover features a unique shape and uses four thrusters (two vertical + two horizontal) for navigating underwater.

          Designed to make racing games on PC more fun.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Initially started as a DIY build to making the racing experience in PC games more interactive, it quickly evolved into a comprehensive project.
          - The build consists of a steering wheel with capacitive touch-based buttons for brakes and other inputs.
          - The project uses commonly available parts like the Arduino Uno, an ADXL 335, and some wooden and PVC structures for shape and support.
          - The software stack consists of an Arduino Uno that communicates with the Processing IDE via serial communication for implementing keyboard hooks through the robot class.

          A program that can generate and visualize the 3D workspace of an N-DoF manipulator, the project's core is based on the algorithms and applications discussed in the computational physics course by [Dr. P K Thiruvikraman](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/pkthirivikraman/profile).
          - Based on a custom forward kinematics and monte-Carlo-based solver for generating cloud points.
          - The algorithm can generate complex workspace shapes by just relying on the DH-parameters and joint angles as inputs.
          - Potential applications involve collision and interference checking when used together with a planning algorithm.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
