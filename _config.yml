        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started this project to explore the different approaches for control of aerial vehicles ranging from traditional PID and LQR to more complex ones like fuzzy logic and netural networks. The drone also features a custom 3D printed modular frame that is light weight and extremly robust and an inhouse designed flight controller algorithm running on the Nano 33 BLE Sense. The project has a lot of room for improvements and additional features as the Nano 33 BLE Sense supports tinyML.

          Part of a bigger project under [Dr.Abhishek Sarkar](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/abhisheks/Profile) this prototype features a custom planetary gear system along with a 400kv 4114 BLDC motor, on axis magnetic encoder and Odrive. With a final gear ratio of 6:1 the actuator has excellect back-drivability and control. The entire mechanical assembly has been fabricated inhouse and the final prototype of this project will be used in our upcoming quadruped robot project.

          Automation of oxygen flow rate to give the best possible treatment to patients effected with COVID-19.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          A sponsered project in-association with Yashoda Hospitals and Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship - BITS Pilani under the guidance of [Mr. Balasubramanian. M](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/balasm/profile), [Dr.Alivelu Manga Parimi](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/alivelu/profile) and [Dr.Pratyush Chakraborty](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/pchakraborty/Profile). The project involved the automation of the oxygen flow regulator based on an expert-advice system for patients who needed oxygen support, the system not only reduced the need for constant supervision of the patients condition but also reduced oxygen wastage by automatically adjusting the oxygen flowrate based on the patients vitals and also recorded all the data for further analysis.

          A research project under [Dr. K Rajitha](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/krajitha/Profile) aimed at implementing realtime orthomosaic map based navigation and SLAM using a single vertical facing camera. This project is a step towards a cheap and affordable drone based surveying platform that doesn't rely on external services like GPS and satellite data for localization. It has applications ranging from helping first responders get a good understand of the map after terrain alterning natural/artifical events to surveying construction sites, farm lands and forests.
